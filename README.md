As a high school student that enjoys programming and guitar, I am very prone to repetitive strain injuries. I switched to Dvorak looking for ergonomics... and maybe it helped? Anyways, a common annoyance for Dvorak users is not having qwerty shortcuts. This keyboard layout does not utilize drivers and works natively like the original.

My creation is programmer Dvorak with qwerty shortcuts. I made it because no one else ever did. CTRL, ALT, and WIN all work with qwerty shortcuts.

What is special about this is that unlike the other layouts, the number keys are activated when caps lock is on - exactly how the original layout was intended. This allows you to type numbers without holding shift (an annoyance in programmer Dvorak that sacrifices numbers for easy access to symbols)

Created with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator.

Note: Only for windows. Linux and Mac already come with this I believe.
